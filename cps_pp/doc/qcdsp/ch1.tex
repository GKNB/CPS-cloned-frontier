\chapter{Introduction}
These notes are an attempt at gently introducing a new
user to the QCDSP computer. It reflects my own particular
path of learning (which may or may not do me credit). 

\section{Organisation}
We begin in chapter \ref{c:HelloWorld} where we discuss
some introductory aspects of the QCDSP, including how 
to boot a QCDSP machine and how to run a simple 
{\em``Hello World''} application.

\section{Notational conventions}
Generally, when illustrating dialogue with the computer
we shall use the {\tt teletype font}. Filenames shall usually
be denoted in {\bf bold face}.
