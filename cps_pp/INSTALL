The new system only creates one library: cps.a
The system probably requires gnu make, so 
you may need to use gmake.

These are the instruction to compile the cps++
code using the build system developed by the 
Columbia group.

It is advised not to build this code inside the 
source code directory.

From this directory the steps you need to take to 
compile the code are:

mkdir ../cps++_build
cd ../cps++_build
../cps++/configure
make

Testing
--------
To use the testing framework you need to type
make install

This copies the makefiles for the testing framework from the 
cps++_build directory to the cps++ directory. The testing framework
is then in "tests".

NOTES
----
This build system may have problems in read only
check outs, as it involves copying of files around
the build tree.

Also remember to check the code out with "cvs co -P cps++",
because the empty directories cause problems with 
the build system.

To run the test suite:
make test

Full instructions for comfiguration and compilation can be found in

./doc/porting/porting.html
